Digital Art
------------------
Art is a way to express people’s feelings, ideas, and views to interpret their perspective of life and the events around them. I tried to make my painting tell an emotional story about my country’s culture and beliefs. Art gives us the freedom to go beyond reality in order to show the darkside clearly, what we could not do  by speaking about it.
